                                                                ONE BIT ALU
                                                                
This is a verilog implementation of a 1 bit ALU that can perform the following logical and arithmetic operations - AND,OR,NOR,NAND,ADD and SUBTRACT. There are 2 additional flags -

 1. Flag to check whether the result of the ALU operation is zero
 2. Flag to check whether the first input is greater than the second input.
 

The ALU inputs must fit one the following combinations: 

 
 ainv  binv  carryin operation   
 
  0     0      X        00     -- AND  
  0     0      X        01     -- OR
  1     1      X        00     -- NOR
  1     1      X        01     -- NAND
  0     0      0        00     -- ADD
  0     1      1        00     -- SUBTRACT
